# Getting Started with Astro

Astro is a modern web framework that's changing the way we build websites. Unlike traditional frameworks that ship tons of JavaScript to the browser, Astro takes a different approach: **it ships zero JavaScript by default**.

## Why Astro?

Here are the key reasons why Astro stands out:

### 1. **Performance First**
Astro generates static HTML at build time, resulting in incredibly fast page loads. JavaScript is only added when you explicitly need it.

### 2. **Islands Architecture**
Astro pioneered the "Islands Architecture" pattern. This means you can use interactive components (React, Vue, Svelte) only where needed, while keeping the rest of your page static.

### 3. **Content Collections**
Built-in support for type-safe content management makes working with Markdown and MDX a breeze.

## Quick Start

Getting started with Astro is simple:

```bash
# Create a new project
npm create astro@latest

# Navigate to your project
cd my-astro-site

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the dev server
npm run dev
```

## Creating Your First Component

Astro components use a `.astro` extension and have a unique syntax:

```astro
---
// Component Script (runs at build time)
const greeting = 'Hello, World!';
---

<div class="greeting">
	<h1>{greeting}</h1>
	<p>Welcome to Astro!</p>
</div>

<style>
	.greeting {
		padding: 2rem;
		background: linear-gradient(to right, #ec4899, #a855f7);
	}
</style>
```

## Key Features

- **File-based Routing**: Pages in `src/pages/` automatically become routes
- **Markdown Support**: Write content in Markdown or MDX
- **Zero JS by Default**: Ship only the JavaScript you need
- **Framework Agnostic**: Use React, Vue, Svelte, or any framework you prefer
- **TypeScript Ready**: First-class TypeScript support out of the box

## Performance Benefits

Astro sites are incredibly fast because:

1. Static HTML is generated at build time
2. No hydration waterfall like traditional SPAs
3. Partial hydration for interactive components
4. Automatic image optimization
5. Built-in asset optimization

## Conclusion

Astro is perfect for:
- **Content-heavy sites** (blogs, documentation, marketing sites)
- **E-commerce** (product pages, landing pages)
- **Portfolios** (showcasing your work)

If you're building a content-focused website and performance is a priority, Astro should be at the top of your list.
